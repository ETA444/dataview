# Welcome to `DataView 1.0`
### Quick way to get basic visualizations and descriptive statistics from a .csv file.

- **Mission:** My mission with DataView is to create a simple way to gain a birds-eye view of a dataset through basic visualizations and descriptive statistics. Aside from cleaning data this is the first step everyone takes when they start working with a dataset.
- **Languages:** This idea started off as a Ruby script, however due to limitations of Ruby when it comes to data science, I have chosen to consolidate it and continue in Python exclusively. The Ruby script is kept as the legacy of the idea (`dataview.rb`).

## Folders & Files
- **main**
	- `dataview.rb`:  legacy script of the DataView idea in Ruby.
- **testing files**
	- `samplecsv-1.csv`: sample dataset with various data types and 100000 rows
